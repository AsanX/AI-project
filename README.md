# Project Title

EcoSaver

## Summary

EcoSaver addresses the widespread issue of energy wastage in households by utilizing smart home data and AI techniques.
The project aims to optimize energy usage, reduce environmental impact, and lower energy bills.

## Background

The problem EcoSaver aims to address is the challenge of energy wastage in residential buildings. Many households face the issue of unintentional energy consumption due to appliances being left on, lights being unnecessarily left on, or heating/cooling systems running when not needed. This problem is common across the globe and contributes to both energy and cost wastage.

## How is it used?

EcoSaver is utilized in households to provide insights into energy consumption patterns.
It is accessible to homeowners who are interested in optimizing their energy usage, reducing their carbon footprint, and saving on energy bills.
The solution is user-friendly, offering personalized recommendations based on individual habits and preferences.

## Data sources and AI methods
EcoSaver relies on data from smart home devices, such as smart plugs, smart thermostats, and occupancy sensors. 
The AI techniques employed include machine learning algorithms for predicting usage patterns, anomaly detection to identify wasteful energy consumption, and natural language processing for user interaction. 
A demo might include a dashboard illustrating real-time energy usage and recommendations for improvement.

## Challenges

EcoSaver does not solve infrastructure-related challenges, such as inefficient appliances or poor insulation. It focuses on optimizing the usage of existing systems. 
The effectiveness also relies on user engagement and willingness to adopt energy-efficient practices.

## What next?

The project could grow by integrating with smart home ecosystems, partnering with energy utility companies for more comprehensive insights, and incorporating predictive maintenance features for appliances. Expansion into commercial spaces and collaborating with city-level initiatives could further extend its impact.
